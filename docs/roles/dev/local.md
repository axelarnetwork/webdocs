# Local test environment

Axelar offers a local test environment capable of emulating a complex ecosystem of multiple EVM blockchains and the Axelar overlay network that connects them. Test your dapps locally, then deploy to testnet or mainnet.

See [axelar-local-dev git repo README](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-local-dev) for more.

## Examples

- [Simple](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-local-dev/tree/main/examples/simple). Set up two EVM chains, transfer tokens from one chain to the other, send a "Hello world!" message to a contract on both chains.
- [Metamask](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-local-dev/tree/main/examples/metamask). Set up two EVM chains and a simple web page to connect Metamask and transfer tokens from one chain to the other.
- [Remote](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-local-dev/tree/main/examples/remote). Set up a test environment and connect to it remotely.
- [Token linker](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-local-dev/tree/main/examples/tokenLinker). Use cross-chain contract calls to transfer ERC-20 tokens across EVM chains.
