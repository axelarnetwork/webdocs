# Bug bounty

There are two ways to disclose security vulnerabilities to the Axelar team:

1. Submit a report to our <a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/axelarnetwork/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bug bounty program</a>.
2. Send email to `security@axelar.network` describing the vulnerability.

Even if your security vulnerability is not eligible for a bounty from the bug bounty program (option 1) the Axelar team might decide to award a bounty for a security vulnerability submitted by email to `security@axelar.network` (option 2).
