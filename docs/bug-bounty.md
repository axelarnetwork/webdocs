# Bug bounty, disclosure of sercurity vulnerabilities

Axelar is currently concluding collaborations with external partners on a process for disclosure of security vulnerabilities and a bug bounty program. In the meantime, here's what you need to know:

* A _security vulnerability_ is a software bug that might compromise safety or liveness of the Axelar network. Examples include loss of funds or an unwanted network halt. Security vulnerabilities can have a range of severity levels.
* If you find a security vulnerability then please send an email to `security@axelar.network` describing the vulnerability. Include all necessary information such as a description of the vulnerability, how to reproduce it, and the potential consequences.
* The Axelar team will review submissions and award cash bounties to those who disclose valid vulnerabilities in such a way that we are able to patch the vulnerability before it is exploited.
